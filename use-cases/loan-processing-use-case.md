# 🏦 AI-Powered Loan Application Processing Using LLMs

## 📌 Use Case Title
**End-to-End Loan Document Evaluation with LLM-Based Scoring System**

---

## ❗ Business Problem

Banks receive thousands of loan applications daily, each accompanied by multiple supporting documents (e.g., ID proof, payslips, bank statements, IT returns).  
Manually reviewing these documents to assess customer eligibility is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error — resulting in processing delays and poor customer experience.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To automate document understanding and loan eligibility scoring using a two-stage LLM-based pipeline, reducing manual workload and increasing decision-making speed and accuracy.

## 🛠️ Solution Architecture

### ✅ Step 1: Document Collection
- Customers upload required documents via a secure digital portal (PDFs or images).

### ✅ Step 2: Document Extraction
- If the uploaded document is a **PDF**, we can extract the content using Python libraries such as **PyMuPDF (`fitz`)**, **pdfplumber**, or **PDFMiner**.
- If the uploaded file is an **image**, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools such as **Tesseract**, **Google Vision API**, or **Amazon Textract** are used to extract raw text.


### ✅ Step 3: LLM + Prompt — Document Understanding
- The extracted text is sent to a Large Language Model (LLM) using a carefully designed prompt.
- You can use models such as **OpenAI (GPT-4)**, **Meta's LLaMA**, **Mistral**, or **Anthropic's Claude**, depending on your infrastructure and use case.
- The LLM processes and converts the raw text into a structured JSON format:


```json
{
  "name": "Rahul Sharma",
  "monthly_income": 65000,
  "existing_loans": 1,
  "credit_score": 780,
  "employment_status": "Permanent",
  "loan_amount_requested": 400000
}
```

### ✅ Step 4: LLM + Prompt — Eligibility Scoring
- The structured JSON is fed into a second LLM prompt that evaluates loan eligibility and outputs:

```json
{
  "loan_eligibility_score": 86,
  "risk_level": "Low",
  "recommendation": "Eligible for approval"
}
```

## 🌟 Optional Enhancements

- Add human-in-the-loop (HITL) review for edge cases or high-risk applications.  
- Store structured data and logs for regulatory compliance and auditing.  
- Implement a feedback loop to fine-tune LLM prompts based on historical approval/rejection outcomes.

## 🔁 Reusability

This architecture is adaptable and reusable for several other use cases, including:

✅ Insurance claims processing  
✅ Credit card application screening  
✅ Government form/document validation  
✅ Student loan processing  
✅ Employment verification systems

## 📌 Summary

By combining OCR with the power of Large Language Models, banks and financial institutions can significantly reduce manual efforts, improve decision consistency, and deliver a seamless customer experience in loan application processing.
